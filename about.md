ADRN (Austin Disaster Recovery Network) – supplements ham radio operations to needs assessment and disaster recovery efforts
CTECC (Combined Transportation, Emergency, and Communications Center) ARES equips and mans a radio room connected to the EOC that commands all emergencies in the city and county

Red Cross in addition to providing back-up communications as needed, ARES maintains the antennas at the Central Texas Red Cross Center on Pershing Drive
