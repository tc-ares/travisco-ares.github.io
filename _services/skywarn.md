TCARES is a SKYWARN partner organization.  During weather events TCARES activates a weather net for amateur radio operators to report rainfall rates, strong winds or whatever type of weather report the net control operator is currently requesting.

In most years, thunderstorms, tornadoes and lightning caused hundreds of injuries and deaths and billions in property and crop damages.  To obtain critical weather information, the National Weather Service (NWS) established SKYWARN® with partner organizations.

National Weather Service (NWS) encourages anyone with an interest in public service to join the SKYWARN® program.  Please find more information about this program at https://www.weather.gov/skywarn/.
