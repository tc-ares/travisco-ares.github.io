The Amateur Radio Communication for Hospital Emergency Service (ARCHES) purpose is to provide voice and digital communications for hospitals in the event that an emergency incident disables telephone and internet services. Communication with other hospitals, incident command centers (EOCâ€™s) and others is conducted through radio channels allocated to the Amateur service. Radio connection to Winlink worldwide servers provides digital communication both for conventional e-mail service and the transmission of ICS and HICS forms.
