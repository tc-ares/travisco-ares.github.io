As outlined on the Amateur Radio Relay League, ARRL website, the Amateur Radio Emergency ServiceÂ® (ARES) consists of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment, with their local ARES leadership, for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes.

Joining the Travis County Amateur Radio Emergency Service, (TCARES), located in Travis County, Texas, is outlined below.

# Membership Requirements

- Every licensed amateur, regardless of membership in ARRL or any other local or national organization, is eligible to apply for membership in ARES. Training may be required or desired to participate fully in ARES. Because ARES is an Amateur Radio program, only licensed radio amateurs are eligible for membership. The possession of emergency-powered equipment is desirable but is not a requirement for membership.

- The second requirement is a desire to serve.

# How to Join

In lieu of the ARRL paper registration form, we have an on-line form that collects the same info but also allows you to return and enter/track your training. This also allows the ARES leadership at the county, district, or section level to generate reports based on training, equipment, or rosters. 

- To register as a new member, follow this link [New Member Registration Form](https://www.arrlstxvps.org/vault_area/vault_gateway/site_gateway/vault_profile.php). 

- Once you have completed and submitted your registration form an TCARES officer will send you a login and password to the South Texas Section Amateur Radio Emergency Service member database.

# Training

TCARES is dedicated to training its members the skills needed to assist in Emergency Communications during the time of disasters. To participate in TCARES activations that are several three levels of training that will determine your level of participation during any activation.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) now requires all volunteers, including amateur radio operators, to have completed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) IS-100.c, IS-200.c, IS-700.b and IS-800.c course material.
TCARES members will be expected to understand and operate under National Incident Management System (NIMS) during activation.
Without this training, you may be excluded from participating or gaining access to emergency sites during activation.
