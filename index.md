# Travis County ARES

This group is a county-level unit of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES), a part of the division and section structure of the ARRLâ€˜s field organization. We consist of licensed amateurs who have voluntarily registered their qualifications and equipment for communications duty in the public service when disaster strikes. The group headquarters is in Austin, Travis County, Texas.
